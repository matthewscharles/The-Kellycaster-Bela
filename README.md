# The-Kellycaster-Bela
Bela part of the Kellycaster setup - a guitar designed by John Kelly.

We use Bela to send OSC back and forth with a Max for Live patch - I'm also working on a version with internal MIDI processing and probably some synthesis/sample playback as well.

I decided to move this out of our private GitHub repo to re-merge at a later date.  In order to make the Max for Live portions public, we will need to create some generic songbooks and chord libraries, and we currently have other priorities...
